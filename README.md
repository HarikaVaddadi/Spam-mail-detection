# Spam-mail-detection

In this repo, we will identify a mail as spam or ham using a machine learning algorithm called SVM.

# Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm and the main idea is to create a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes/categories.
The separating hyperplane is optimal and maximizes the margin that separates the categories, in this case the categories are spam and ham.

# Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn

# Usage
Dataset is attached.
